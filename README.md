# BootstrapWithWordpress
**A Custom Theme built for Wordpress with the support of Bootstrap.**

A dynamic website with good looking homepage and power of Wordpress to include the Blogging features to the site.
#### Technologies Used:
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Bootstrap4
+ PHP
+ Wordpress.org
+ Theme Layout build with [Underscore.me](https://underscores.me/)

##### Strategy: 
Intially, I developed the webpages simply with the help of CSS and bootstrap and then customized the wordpress theme layout generated with the help of underscore.me to make the website dynamic, while staying in loop with the initially built static webpages.

**_Check out the static UI of the project_**: 

**Note**: The website hosted on Netlify is just a static UI of what I built on Wordpress. You can download the _bootstraptowordpress.zip_ file to check and use the complete implementation of Theme.

##### Learning:
+ Refreshed my basics; HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and PHP.
+ Learned about wordpress core implementation.
+ Played with different plugins and custom fields.
+ Deep customizations and insights of wordpress themes; for eg. menubars, sidebars, index page, etc.
+ Roles of different .php files in wordpress; like functions.php, page.php, single.php, 404 page, etc.
